### **Matching the Terms:**

1. **SEC (Socio-Economic Classification)**

   **Correct Match:** 
A system to classify households based on the education and occupation of the CWE

* SEC is used in marketing and media research to classify consumers.
* It takes the Chief Wage Earner’s (CWE’s) education and occupation into account.
* Helps understand consumer behavior, preferences, and purchasing power.

---

2. **CWE (Chief Wage Earner)**

   **Correct Match:** 
The person who contributes maximum money towards the running of the household

* The CWE is not necessarily the head of the family; they are simply the main income earner.
* Used for classifying the household socio-economically (e.g., for SEC or NCCS categories).

---

3. **Household**

   **Correct Match:** 
People from one family living together under one roof and eating food prepared in the same kitchen

* This is the Census definition of a household.
* It focuses on shared living and cooking arrangements, not just blood relations.

---

4. **NCCS (New Consumer Classification System)**

   **Correct Match:** 
A system to classify households based on the education of the Chief Wage Earner and the number of durables owned

* This newer classification method considers:

  * CWE’s education
  * Ownership of durable goods (TV, fridge, AC, etc.)
* It gives a better socio-economic snapshot than the older SEC method.

---

5. **Urban Definition**

   **Correct Match:** 
A place where the population density is at least 400 per sq. km, the governing body is a municipal corporation, and not more than 25% is engaged in agricultural occupation

* This is the official definition by Census of India to define urban areas.
* Helps distinguish urban from rural based on density, governance, and occupation patterns.

### **Select True/False:**

6. **The height of men in a country tends to be normally distributed**

   **Correct Answer:** True

* Physical characteristics like height follow a normal (bell-curve) distribution.
* Most values cluster around the average, with fewer at the extremes.

---

7. **Approximately 95% of the values in a normal distribution tend to lie within ±2 standard deviations from the mean**

   **Correct Answer:** True

* This is part of the Empirical Rule:

  * 68% within ±1 SD
  * 95% within ±2 SD
  * 99.7% within ±3 SD
* It shows how data spreads around the mean in a normal distribution.

---

8. **Approximately 75% of the values in a normal distribution tend to lie within ±2 standard deviations**

   **Correct Answer:** False

* The correct figure is about 95%, not 75%.
* 75% would significantly underestimate the true coverage of values.

---

9. **The normal distribution is shaped like a tennis ball**

   **Correct Answer:** False

* A normal distribution is bell-shaped, not spherical like a tennis ball.
* It has a peak at the mean and symmetric tapering tails.

---

10. **Approximately 95% of the values in a normal distribution tend to lie within ±3 standard deviations**

   **Correct Answer:** False

* This is incorrect; 99.7% of values lie within ±3 SD, not 95%.
* 95% corresponds to ±2 SD.

---

11. **The Central Limit Theorem says that when the sample size is 30 or more, then the distribution of the universe becomes normal**

   **Correct Answer:** False

* The universe (population) does not change.
* The Central Limit Theorem says the **sampling distribution of the sample mean** becomes approximately normal when sample size ≥ 30, even if the population is not normal.

---

12. **There are many kinds of frequency distributions, of which normal distribution is one kind**
    
   **Correct Answer:** True

* Other distributions include:

  * Uniform (equal probability)
  * Binomial (success/failure)
  * Poisson (rare events)
  * Skewed distributions
* Normal is just one among many types.

---

13. **When the sample size is more than 30, the sampling distribution has a lower mean**
    
   **Correct Answer:** False

* The mean of the sampling distribution remains the same as the population mean.
* What changes with larger samples is the standard error (it becomes smaller), not the mean.

---

14. **When the population is normally distributed, then the sampling distribution tends to be normal with a sample size as low as 20**
    
   **Correct Answer:** True

* If the population is already normal, then even small sample sizes (like 20) will result in a sampling distribution that is also normal.

---

15. **When it comes to estimating height through a sample survey, men and women should be treated as one population**
    
   **Correct Answer:** False

* Men and women have different average heights and variation.
* It’s better to treat them as two separate strata and stratify the sample accordingly.
