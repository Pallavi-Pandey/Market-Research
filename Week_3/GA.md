### **1. Which is more suitable for finding out the reasons for customer dissatisfaction?**

**Correct Answer: Open-ended question**

* **Why?** Open-ended questions let customers **express their exact reasons** in their own words.
* Scales (5-point, 7-point, NPS) measure **level of satisfaction**, but not **why** they are dissatisfied.
* **Behavior probing** may help in interviews but is less effective in surveys.

### **2. When dealing with affluent and well-educated respondents, the following are important**

**Correct Answer: None of the above**

* **Why?** Affluent and educated respondents usually prefer **structured, concise, and direct** questions.
* They do not necessarily need **translation**, **pictorial aids**, or specific **scales** unless the topic demands it.
* Hence, none of the given options are particularly important just because the respondent is affluent and educated.

### **3. Open-ended questions are in general preferable to close-ended questions**

**Correct Answer: False**

* **Why?** Open-ended questions are harder to analyze and code.
* In general, **close-ended questions** are preferred in **quantitative surveys** for ease of analysis and consistency.
* Open-ended questions are best for **exploratory or qualitative** research.

---

### **4. Close-ended questions are in general preferable to open-ended questions**

**Correct Answer: False**

* **Why?** The correct answer should have been **True**, because close-ended questions are usually more **efficient** and **analyzable**.
* The accepted answer "False" is incorrect.

### **5. It is better to have a mid-point in a scale**

**Correct Answer: True**

* **Why?** A mid-point allows respondents to express a **neutral or undecided** opinion.
* Without a mid-point, some may be **forced** to take a position they don’t actually have.

---

### **6. Balanced scales are better than unbalanced scales**

**Correct Answer: True**

* **Why?** Balanced scales give **equal weight** to positive and negative responses, reducing bias.
* Unbalanced scales may **push** responses in a particular direction.

---

### **7. The semantic differential scale and the Likert scale are the same**

**Correct Answer: False**

* **Why?**

  * **Likert scale**: Measures agreement (e.g., Strongly agree to Strongly disagree)
  * **Semantic differential**: Uses **bipolar adjectives** (e.g., Happy — Sad)
* They are both **rating scales**, but **not the same**.

---

### **8. The Likert scale is a metric scale**

**Correct Answer: True**

* **Why?** Likert scales are **treated as interval (metric)** scales for analysis, especially when combining multiple items.

---

### **9. The semantic differential scale is a non-metric scale**

**Correct Answer: True**

* **Why?** Though it appears numeric, the semantic differential scale is **based on subjective interpretation**, and technically is **ordinal or non-metric** in some contexts.

---

### **10. The association scale is a nominal scale**

**Correct Answer: True**

* **Why?** Association scales ask which words or images are **associated** with something, and the responses are **categorical**, not ordered.

---

### **11. Ranking questions use the ordinal scale**

**Correct Answer: True**

* **Why?** Ranking implies **order**, but not the magnitude of difference between ranks, hence it's **ordinal**.

---

### **12. The median is a good measure for ranking questions**

**Correct Answer: True**

* **Why?** Median is appropriate for **ordinal data** like rankings, as it doesn’t require equal intervals between values like the mean does.
