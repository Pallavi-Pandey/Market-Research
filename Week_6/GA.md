### 1. It is possible for an ad to enjoy high cut-through but low persuasion

**Answer: True**
An ad might be highly memorable (high recall), but if it doesn’t influence purchase intent or brand preference, persuasion is low. Cut-through and persuasion are different.

### 2. Persuasion is a key metric for ad performance

**Answer: True**
Persuasion reflects how much an ad motivates consumers to act or change their preference — it's central to evaluating an ad's effectiveness.

### 3. Persuasion is directly linked to the brand proposition

**Answer: True**
If the brand's value or benefit isn't clearly communicated, persuasion suffers. A strong brand proposition strengthens persuasive impact.

### 4. Persuasion can be high or low, but it doesn’t affect ad performance

**Answer: False**
Persuasion directly impacts brand performance. An ad with low persuasion typically won't lead to increased interest, preference, or sales.

### 5. If an ad scores high in a pretest, media spend need not be high

**Answer: False**
Even a great ad needs to be seen. Without adequate media spend, reach and frequency are limited, reducing overall impact.

### 6. If an ad gets high recall, it is safe to assume it is also liked

**Answer: False**
An ad may be recalled for reasons other than liking (e.g., it was shocking, confusing, or controversial). Recall and liking are separate measures.

### 7. The best ads cut through well, convey a message, and are interesting

**Answer: True**
Effective ads do all three: grab attention, deliver a clear message, and keep the viewer engaged.

### 8. A high persuasion score for an ad should result in some increase in sales

**Answer: True**
High persuasion usually indicates that the ad is likely to change consumer behavior, which often leads to sales uplift.

### 9. Brand registration is never an issue for a famous brand

**Answer: False**
Even famous brands can fail to be associated with the ad if branding isn’t prominent or clear. This is called poor brand linkage.

### 10. Ad pre-testing can be done among both users and non-users of the brand

**Answer: True**
Pre-testing with both groups helps understand how the ad performs across the market — not just among loyal users.
