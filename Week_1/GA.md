Q1. **Stratified sampling is the most accurate because it reduces heterogeneity**

Sol: True

**Explanation:** 

Stratified sampling divides the population into homogeneous subgroups (strata), reducing variability within each group and increasing accuracy.

---

Q2. **Systematic sampling is not suitable for sampling from a list**

Sol: False

**Explanation:** 

Systematic sampling is suitable for lists, especially when the list has no hidden pattern. It involves selecting every *k-th* item from the list.

---

Q3. **Quota sampling and Stratified sampling are the same**

**Explanation:** 

They both involve grouping, but **stratified sampling is probabilistic** and uses random selection, while **quota sampling is non-probabilistic** and selection is based on convenience.

---

Q4. **Convenience sampling with a large sample size is as good as probability sampling**

Sol: False

**Explanation:** 

Even a large **convenience sample** can be biased and unrepresentative, whereas **probability sampling** ensures each unit has a known chance of selection.

---

Q5. **A population of 5 million requires 10 times the sample size as a population of 0.5 million**

Sol: False

**Explanation:** 

Sample size does **not increase proportionally** with population size. Beyond a certain point, larger populations require only **slightly larger** samples.

---

Q6. **Sample size determination does not vary by population size**

Sol: True

**Explanation:** 

For large populations, sample size mainly depends on **margin of error and confidence level**, not total population size.

---

Q7. **Qualitative research is better than quantitative research for studies that require validation and measurement.**

Sol: False

**Explanation:** 

**Quantitative research** is better for measurement and validation due to its structured, numerical nature.

---

Q8. **Quantitative research is better than qualitative research for studies that require exploratory insight.**

Sol: False

**Explanation:** 

**Qualitative research** is better for **exploration**, uncovering motivations and underlying reasons.

---

Q9. **Demand estimation studies require quantitative research**

Sol: True

**Explanation:** 

Estimating demand involves **numerical analysis** like forecasting, which is best done with **quantitative methods**.

---

Q10. **Industrial research calls for a high level of domain knowledge**

Sol: True

**Explanation:** 

Industrial research is often technical and complex, requiring **expertise** in the specific domain.

---

Q11. **Stratified sampling is the most commonly used for group discussions**

Sol: False

**Explanation:** 

**Group discussions** (qualitative) often use **purposive or convenience sampling**, not stratified sampling, which is used for quantitative studies.

---

Q12. **Snowballing sampling is very useful when the target group is difficult to locate**

Sol: True

**Explanation:** 

Snowball sampling uses **referrals** from existing participants, making it ideal for **hidden or rare populations**.

---

Q13. **Mystery shopping is a good method to check whether processes are being followed**

Sol: True

**Explanation:** 

Mystery shoppers **pose as customers** to observe and evaluate service processes in real-time, without alerting staff.

---

Q14. **Stock audits by sales executives are a form of mystery shopping**

Sol: False

**Explanation:** 

Stock audits are **announced checks** by internal employees, not anonymous evaluations like mystery shopping.

---

Q15. **Populations that have more heterogeneity require a larger sample size than populations with more homogeneity.**

Sol: True

**Explanation:** 

More variability in the population means a **larger sample** is needed to accurately represent all subgroups.
