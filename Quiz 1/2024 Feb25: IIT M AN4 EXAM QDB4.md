## Question 1: 
A company plans to conduct a house-to-house field survey to determine the penetration of water heaters. The required sample size is 500 households, specifically targeting middle-income households across various locations.

### Select the most appropriate sampling method:

- [ ] Multistage cluster sampling
- [ ] Stratified sampling
- [ ] Quota sampling
- [ ] Systematic sampling
- [ ] Convenience sampling

## Solution 
**Correct Answer:** Multistage cluster sampling

### Reasoning:
1. **Geographic Distribution:**  
   The house-to-house nature of the survey indicates significant geographic spread and logistical considerations.

2. **Target Population Characteristics:**  
   While focusing on middle-income households, these are likely to be scattered across different areas.

3. **Why Multistage Cluster Sampling Works Best:**  
   This method is particularly effective for large, geographically dispersed populations because it:
   - First selects primary clusters (e.g., cities or districts)
   - Then chooses sub-clusters within them (e.g., neighborhoods or blocks)
   - Finally samples individual households within those sub-clusters
   
   This approach optimizes field resources while maintaining the randomness and representativeness of the sample.
