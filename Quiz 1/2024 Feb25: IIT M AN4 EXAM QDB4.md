## Question 1: 
A company plans to conduct a house-to-house field survey to determine the penetration of water heaters. The required sample size is 500 households, specifically targeting middle-income households across various locations.

### Select the most appropriate sampling method:

- [ ] Multistage cluster sampling
- [ ] Stratified sampling
- [ ] Quota sampling
- [ ] Systematic sampling
- [ ] Convenience sampling

---

## Solution 
**Correct Answer:** Multistage cluster sampling

### Reason:
The survey is house-to-house, which implies geographic spread and field logistics matter.

The target group is middle-income households, but they are geographically scattered.

Multistage cluster sampling is effective for large, geographically dispersed populations, where you can:

- First select clusters (e.g., cities or neighborhoods)
- Then sub-clusters (e.g., blocks or streets)
- And finally households within them.
