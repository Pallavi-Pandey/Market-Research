## Question 1: 
For the following situations, what sampling method is optimal? A company plans to do a house-to-house field survey to find the penetration of water heaters. The required sample size is 500, spread across middle income households

### Options :

- [ ] Multistage cluster sampling
- [ ] Stratified sampling
- [ ] Quota sampling
- [ ] Systematic sampling
- [ ] Convenience sampling

## Solution 
**Correct Answer:** Multistage cluster sampling

### Reason:
The survey is house-to-house, which implies geographic spread and field logistics matter.

The target group is middle-income households, but they are geographically scattered.

Multistage cluster sampling is effective for large, geographically dispersed populations, where you can:

- First select clusters (e.g., cities or neighborhoods)
- Then sub-clusters (e.g., blocks or streets)
- And finally households within them.

## Question 2:
For the following situations, what sampling method is optimal? An insurance company wants to do a customer satisfaction study over phone with customers who have claimed insurance within the last six months. The required sample size is 450 customers.

### Options :

- [ ] Multistage cluster sampling
- [ ] Stratified sampling
- [ ] Quota sampling
- [ ] Systematic sampling
- [ ] Convenience sampling

## Solution 
**Correct Answer:** Systematic sampling

### Reason:
The insurance company has a well-defined population: customers who claimed insurance in the last six months.

These customers can likely be listed in a database or CRM system.

From this list, the company can:

- Randomly select a starting point.
- Call every k-th customer to reach a sample of 450.

## Question 3:
For the following situations, what sampling method is optimal? A biscuits company wants to conduct a small sample study to understand to what extent the main distributors have adopted the company’s new channel management software. The required sample size is 20, and the nature of probing will be in-depth.

### Options :

- [ ] Multistage cluster sampling
- [ ] Stratified sampling
- [ ] Quota sampling
- [ ] Systematic sampling
- [ ] Convenience sampling

## Solution 
**Correct Answer:** Convenience sampling

### Reason:
The sample size is very small (only 20).

The study aims to conduct in-depth probing, likely qualitative in nature.

The population (main distributors) is small and known, possibly accessible directly to the company.

In such cases, the company may choose readily available or cooperative distributors for ease and speed.

## Question 4:
For the following situations, what sampling method is optimal? A garments company plans to understand feedback on a new clothing item meant for use by pregnant women while going about their daily routine. The targeted sample size is 25 and the probing will be qualitative in nature

### Options :

- [ ] Multistage cluster sampling
- [ ] Stratified sampling
- [ ] Quota sampling
- [ ] Systematic sampling
- [ ] Convenience sampling

## Solution 
**Correct Answer:** Convenience sampling

### Reason:
The sample size is very small (only 25).

The study aims to conduct qualitative probing.

The population (pregnant women) is likely accessible through existing customer databases or through distributors.

In such cases, the company may choose readily available or cooperative distributors for ease and speed.

## Question 5:
For the following situations, what sampling method is optimal? An airline wants to know how satisfied its passengers are with the in-flight service. The company wants a sample size of 300 customers selected in such a way as to ensure proportionate representation to flyers on different routes and at different times of day

### Options :

- [ ] Multistage cluster sampling
- [ ] Stratified sampling
- [ ] Quota sampling
- [ ] Systematic sampling
- [ ] Convenience sampling

## Solution 
**Correct Answer:** Stratified sampling

### Reason:
The goal is to ensure proportionate representation of:

- Different routes
- Different times of day

This implies the population (passengers) can be divided into distinct subgroups (strata) based on:

- Flight routes (e.g., Delhi–Mumbai, Chennai–Bangalore)
- Time of day (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening flights)

Then, a random sample is drawn from each stratum proportionately.

This ensures each subgroup is fairly represented in the final sample of 300.

## Question 6:
A manufacturer of biscuits wants to do a sample survey about the popularity of milk-based biscuits. It plans to do a quantitative survey. The company classifies its customers based on gender (male / female) and age (5 to 10 years / 11 to 15 years) and customizes its designs accordingly. The company wants to do the study in only one city. The company wants to have a robust sample size with no compromises. What should be the minimum sample size?

**Correct Answer:** 120

### Reason:
Their are 2 categories of customers: male and female.

There are 2 age groups: 5 to 10 years and 11 to 15 years.

- Total number of strata = 2 * 2 = 4
- Minimum sample size = 4 * 30 = 120

## Question 7:
The same company now decides to do a taste test for its milk biscuits among a random sample of children. The company decides that the key metric will be the liking of the overall taste measured on a 5 point scale from “do not like at all” to like very much”. The company wants to be 95% confident that the findings on the mean score on the 5 point scale is plus or minus 10% accurate. What should be the sample size?

**Correct Answer:** 172

### Reason:
